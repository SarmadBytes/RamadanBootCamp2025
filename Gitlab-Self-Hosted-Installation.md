**In case of Invalid SSL certificate  following steps can help:**
GitLab can auto-generate certificates. Ensure `letsencrypt['enable']` is set to true in `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`: 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure the details are of your own, including the email and URL

```
letsencrypt['enable'] = true 

letsencrypt['contact_emails'] = ['babar@osfp.org.pk']   

external_url "https://git.osfp.org.pk" 

sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure 
```

To Get root password run below command

`cat /etc/gitlab/initial_root_password`
